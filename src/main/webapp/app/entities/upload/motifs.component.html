    <h3>Importance of residues in motifs</h3>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M1</h4>

    <p><strong>M1.4: Thr30 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) with retention of normal levels in the membrane and xanthine transport activity indistinguishable from Cys-less XanQ (Karena and Frillingos, 2009). <strong><em>Gln85 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> is linked with effects on transport catalysis but not substrate binding or expression in the membrane; Gln85-mutants decrease (Q85L, Q85N, Q85E) or abolish (Q85T) the xanthine transport capacity and growth on uric acid or xanthine (Pantazopoulou and Diallinas, 2006)</p>

    <p><strong>M1.5:</strong> <strong>His31 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys or Leu results in low activity and impaired affinity for xanthine and xanthine analogs; replacement by Asn or Gln results in high transport activity and wild-type affinity for xanthine and, in H31Q, additional recognition of some purine bases and analogs that are not wild-type ligands; replacement by Lys or Arg leads to loss of the protein levels in the membrane; it was suggested that His31 is involved in a H-bond that is crucial for retention of the high affinity of the XanQ binding site for xanthine (Karena and Frillingos, 2009); based on the structural evidence from UraA (Lu et al., 2011) such a H-bond interaction might involve His31 and the functionally irreplaceable Asn325 (Karena and Frillingos, 2011). <strong>His37 in UacT. </strong>Functionally irreplaceable: replacement of His37 by Asn, Lys or Leu results in inactivation (H37K, H37L) or marginally detectable activity (H37N) but normal protein levels in the membrane (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012). <strong><em>His86 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> is linked with effects on the proper folding and targeting of UapA to the plasma membrane; His86-mutants H86A, H86K and H86D decrease xanthine transport capacity and growth on uric acid or xanthine, show cryosensitivity and are associated with improper permease targeting effects; however, H86N is indistinguishable in function from wild type, suggesting that the His86 effects on UapA topology/folding involve H-bond interactions (Pantazopoulou and Diallinas, 2006); genetic suppression analysis of H86D reveals partial restoration of growth and permease localization defects by mutation M151V or M151I at TM3 (Amillis et al., 2011)</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M2</h4>

    <p><strong>M2.13. Ser68 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) or Ala results in inactivation and low but significant protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Thr results in a highly active permease which does not differ from wild type in affinity for xanthine but also allows recognition of 8-methylxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.3 mM) and marginal uptake of guanine; the effects might be due to disruption or distortion of a H-bond between Ser68 and Ser91, affecting orientation of the substrate-binding Phe94 which interacts with xanthine-N9 or oxypurinol-N8 via its backbone amide (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M2.14: Gly69 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) leads to inactivation; replacement by Ala results in a highly active permease not differing in affinity for xanthine or transport capacity from wild type but additionally allowing recognition of 8-methylxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.35 mM) (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M2.15: Ile70 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) with retention of high transport activity; I70C does not differ from Cys-less XanQ in affinity for xanthine but additionally allows recognition of 8-methylxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.2 mM) (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M2.16: Gly71 in XanQ.</strong> Irreplaceable for function; replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less background) or Ala leads to inactivation; G71C does not affect the protein levels in the membrane; G71A retains low but significant protein levels in the membrane (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M2.20. Gln75 in XanQ.</strong> Crucial in a H-bond network connecting TM2, TM9, β3 and β10 in XanQ between Gln75 (TM2), Asp304 (TM9), Gln90 (β3) and Thr321 (β10), shown to be essential for the protein stability and function by the analysis of single and combinatorial mutations at Gln75 and Asp304. Gln75 and Asp304 are central in this network as they can form H-bonds with all other partners (Karena et al., 2015). Replacement of Gln75 by Ala, Cys, Glu or Asn results in inactivation and negligible (Q75C, Q75E) or low protein levels in the membrane (Q75A) or unaffected protein levels (Q75N). Combinatorial replacement with Asp304 (individually irreplaceable) in mutant Q75N/D304E rescues significant transport activity (35% of wild type) but with 3- to 5-fold lower affinity for xanthine and oxypurinol (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M3</h4>

    <p><strong>M3.1: Gly83 in XanQ.</strong> Crucial for proper folding and/or insertion in the membrane; replacement by Cys, Pro or Ala leads to abolishment of the membrane protein levels and of any xanthine transport activity (Karena and Frillingos, 2011); Gly83 may be needed to control the protein fold through dictating architecture of TM3; the same is true of Pro318 for TM10 (Karatza et al., 2006). Based on homology modeling and the overall mutagenesis of XanQ, the key folds of TM3 and TM10 in the core domain are sensitive to disruption by abrogating flexibility or rigidity at Gly83 or Pro318, respectively, which, in turn, would destabilize the structure (Karena and Frillingos, 2011; Frillingos, 2012).</p>

    <p><strong>M3.2: Ser84 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background), with retention of high xanthine transport activity that is sensitive to inactivation by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (IC<sub>50</sub> 132 μΜ) (Karena and Frillingos, 2011).</p>

    <p><strong>M3.3: Gly85 in XanQ.</strong> It appears to contribute to the proper folding/insertion in the membrane; replaceable by Ala with retention of high xanthine transport activity but relatively low protein levels in the membrane; however, replacement by Cys or Pro leads to abolishment of the membrane protein levels and of any xanthine transport activity (Karena and Frillingos, 2011).</p>

    <p><strong>M3.4: Leu86 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) with retention of highly significant transport activity that is sensitive to inactivation by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (IC<sub>50</sub> 25 μΜ); the sensitivity to <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide is the same in the absence or presence of substrate (xanthine); replacement of Leu86 by Met or Val results in high (L86M) or low but significant (L86V) xanthine transport activity (Karena and Frillingos, 2011).</p>

    <p><strong>M3.5: Leu87 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background), with retention of highly significant transport activity that is sensitive to inactivation by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (IC<sub>50</sub> 112 μΜ) (Karena and Frillingos, 2011).</p>

    <p><strong>M3.6: Ser88 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints; replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) leads to low but significant activity; replacement by Val leads to inactivation although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Ala leads to retention of significant transport activity (50% of wild-type) and replacement by Thr leads to a highly active permease like wild-type XanQ (Karena and Frillingos, 2011); it may confer to the H-bond network between Gln75-Asp304-Gln90-Thr321 in the core domain that is essential for the protein stability and function (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M3.8: Gln90 in XanQ.</strong> It contributes to a H-bond network connecting TM2, TM9, β3 and β10 in XanQ between Gln75 (TM2), Asp304 (TM9), Gln90 (β3) and Thr321 (β10), shown to be essential for the protein stability and function (Karena et al., 2015); replaceable with Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) with retention of significant transport activity (50% of Cys-less XanQ) (Karena and Frillingos, 2011).</p>

    <p><strong>M3.9: Ser91 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) with retention of high xanthine uptake activity; the activity of single-Cys S91C is inhibited by 40% by 2 mM <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (Karena and Frillingos, 2011); based on homology modeling and molecular dynamics analysis, a H-bond between Ser68 and Ser91 stabilizes TM2 and β3 and affects in the binding site the orientation of Phe94 which interacts with xanthine-N9 or oxypurinol-N8 via its backbone amide (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M3.11: Asn93 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints; crucial for the specificity of XanQ for xanthine; replacement by Cys or Gln results in inactivation; replacement by Thr or Asp results in low activity and, in N93T, impaired affinity for xanthine and xanthine analogs; replacement by Ala or Ser results in high xanthine uptake activity and recognition of the non wild-type ligands 8-methylxanthine, 7-methylxanthine and uric acid (Karena and Frillingos, 2009); N93S and N93A transport xanthine with high affinity and, in addition, they can transport uric acid, albeit with low efficiency; xanthine uptake is inhibited by 8-methylxanthine with <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> of 48 μM (N93S) or 32 μM (N93A) (Karena and Frillingos, 2011); based on homology modeling on UraA (Lu et al., 2011), Asn93 may be involved in a H-bond network between Asn93, Glu272 and Asp276, at the xanthine binding site, which is disrupted when Asn93 is replaced by Ser or Ala allowing recognition of analogs with substitutions at the imidazol moiety (Karena and Frillingos, 2011; Frillingos, 2012); the topologically equivalent H-bond network in UraA has been suggested to provide the basis for coupling substrate transfer with proton translocation (Yu et al., 2017). <strong>Thr100 in UacT. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints; crucial for the specificity of UacT for uric acid; replacement by Asn results in negligible protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Ser results in low uric acid uptake activity but also significant transport activity with xanthine; replacement by Ala results in high transport activity (with comparable efficiencies) for both uric acid and xanthine, changing UacT from a uric-acid selective to a dual-specificity permease (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012); these specificity effects may be due to reorientation of interactions between Thr/Ser/Ala100 and the substrate-binding Glu270 in the binding pocket of UacT (Frillingos, 2012). <strong><em>Ser154 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> has been suggested to be important for the dual specificity of UapA for uric acid and xanthine, but replacements of Ser154 with Ala or Asn show rather minor specificity effects: S154N shows improved affinity for xanthine and compromised affinity for 8-methylxanthine without affecting affinity for uric acid; S154A shows compromised affinity for uric acid and 8-methylxanthine without affecting affinity for xanthine (Amillis al., 2011).</p>

    <p><strong>M3.12: Phe94 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints; replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) leads to an essentially inactive mutant although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Tyr or Ile leads to high xanthine transport activity with 2-fold lower affinity for xanthine and impaired affinity for 3-methylxanthine (F94I) or 2-thio- and 6-thioxanthine (F94Y) (Karena and Frillingos, 2011); based on homology modeling and induced-fit docking, Phe94 interacts with substrate via a H-bond from its backbone amide nitrogen with N9 of xanthine and aromatic packing interactions around xanthine (Karena et al., 2015).<strong> <em>Phe155 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> shows similar binding interactions (Kosti et al., 2012; Alguel et al., 2016); however, replacement of Phe155 by Ala results in high xanthine transport activity (50% of wild-type) and normal growth on uric acid at both 37°C and 25°C (Amillis et al., 2011), without major changes in the specificity profile with respect to purines (Alguel et al., 2016).</p>

    <p><strong>M3.13: Ser95 in XanQ.&nbsp; </strong>Replaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) with retention of high xanthine transport activity (and affinity for xanthine) that is sensitive to inactivation by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (IC<sub>50</sub> 286 μΜ) (Karena and Frillingos, 2011); based on homology modeling and induced-fit docking, Ser95 is peripheral to the binding site and may contribute to the H-bond network between Asn93-Glu272-Asp276 via H-bonds of its hydroxyl group with Glu272 (carboxyl group) and its backbone amide with Asn93 (backbone carbonyl group) (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M4</h4>

    <p><strong>M4.8: Ser151 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) with retention of high xanthine transport activity that is inhibited by 70% by 2 mM <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide; also replaceable by Ala or Thr; these mutants recognize the non-wild type ligand 8-methylxanthine with low (S151A, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.75 mM; S151T, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.85 mM) or moderate affinity (S151C, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.3 mM) without affecting significantly the affinity for xanthine (1.5- to 2-fold increased <em>K</em><sub>m</sub>) (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M4.9: Gly152 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable by Ala with retention of normal protein levels in the membrane, significant transport activity (45% of wild-type) and affinity for xanthine (1.7-fold increased <em>K</em><sub>m</sub> relative to wild type); it also allows recognition of the non-wild type ligand 8-methylxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.5 mM); replacement by Cys leads to complete inactivation and low protein levels in the membrane (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M4.12: Val155 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) or Ile leads to marginal (V155C) or very low activity (V155I) without affecting the protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Met leads to significant transport activity (50% of wild-type) but decreased affinity for xanthine (5-fold increased <em>K</em><sub>m</sub>) and recognition of the non-wild type ligands 7-methlyl- (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.55 mM) and 8-methylxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.45 mM) (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M4.16: Gly159 in XanQ.</strong> Irreplaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) or Ala; G159A and G159C are inactive although retaining normal (G159A) or low but significant (G159C) protein levels in the membrane; flexibility of Gly159 at the interface between TM5 and core domain may be needed in the alternating access mechanism (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M6</h4>

    <p><strong>M6.14: Gly217 in XanQ. </strong>Important for folding/insertion/stability of the protein; irreplaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) with the mutant showing lack of activity and very low protein levels in the membrane; replaceable by Ala with the mutant showing normal protein levels but low transport activity (30% of wild-type) (Karena et al., 2015). It belongs to a conserved GxxxG motif of α-helix ΤΜ7 in NAT/NCS2 transporters. <em>Combinatorial mutagenesis of the corresponding <strong>Gly301 </strong>and Gly305<strong> in the fungal UapA</strong></em> suggested that this motif may be critical for wild-type dimerization/oligomerization, membrane trafficking and turnover of UapA (Martzoukou et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M6.18: Gly221 in XanQ. </strong>Essential for folding/insertion/stability of the protein; irreplaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) or Ala with the mutants showing lack of activity and very low protein levels in the membrane (Karena et al., 2015). It belongs to a conserved GxxxG motif of α-helix ΤΜ7 in NAT/NCS2 transporters. <em>Combinatorial mutagenesis of Gly301 and<strong> Gly305 in the fungal UapA</strong></em> suggested that this motif may be critical for wild-type dimerization/oligomerization, membrane trafficking and turnover of UapA (Martzoukou et al., 2015).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M8</h4>

    <p><strong>M8.11: Glu272 in XanQ. </strong>Functionally essential: replacement by Asp, Gln or Cys leads to inactivation or very low activity (E272D) although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane (Karena and Frillingos, 2009); based on homology modeling, Glu272 interacts directly with xanthine in the binding site via a H-bond from the side chain carboxyl group (Karena et al., 2015) and also forms a H-bond network with Asn93 and Asp276 which might be important for the XanQ specificity (Karena and Frillingos, 2011). <strong>Glu270 in UacT.</strong> Functionally essential: replacement by Asp, Asn or Gln leads to inactivation although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012). <strong><em>Glu356 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> is also functionally essential: replacement by Asp or Gln results in loss of detectable UapA activity without affecting the plasma membrane localization of UapA (Papageorgiou et al., 2008); Glu356 interacts directly with substrate (xanthine) in the binding site via a H-bond from the side chain carboxyl group with N7H of xanthine (Alguel et al., 2016); the phenomenon of UapA endocytosis and turnover elicited by substrate (uric acid) binding is not observed in the loss-of-function mutant E356Q (Gournas et al., 2010); combinatorial replacement of Glu356 by Gln with changes in other critical residues also leads to inactive (E356Q/Q408E, E356Q/N409D) or marginally active mutants (E356Q/T526M) (Papageorgiou et al., 2008).</p>

    <p><strong>M8.12: Ala273 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background), with retention of high xanthine transport activity that is sensitive to inhibition by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.98 mM) (Mermelekas et al., 2010); replacement by Ser leads to high xanthine transport activity with no significant difference in specificity from wild-type but showing lower affinity for xanthine (6-fold increased <em>K</em><sub>m</sub>) (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012). <strong>Ser271 in UacT.</strong> Replacement by Ala leads to abolishment of the protein levels in the membrane (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012). &nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>M8.14: Gly275 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) with retention of high xanthine transport activity that is sensitive to inactivation by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (IC<sub>50</sub> 14.5 μM); sensitivity to <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide is increased in the presence of substrate (IC<sub>50</sub> 7.9 μM, in the presence of 1 mM xanthine) (Mermelekas et al., 2010).&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>M8.15: Asp276 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Gln, His, Met, Val or Ile leads to inactivation; replacement by Gly, Cys, or Ala leads to marginal activity (5-10% of wild-type) and impaired binding affinity for xanthine; replacement by Asn or Thr leads to very low activity (20-25% of wild-type) without affecting affinity for xanthine; replacement by Glu leads to high transport activity and affinity for xanthine but with altered substrate profile (impaired affinity for 2-thio-, 6-thio- and 3-methylxanthine, recognition of 8-methylxanthine with <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 79 μM) and different pH-activity/specificity profile than wild-type XanQ; all of the mutants display normal protein levels in the membrane (Mermelekas et al., 2010); it appears that the side chain carboxyl group at this position is essential for the XanQ transport activity but the geometry of the carboxyl group is also essential for proper substrate specificity and proton coupling (Mermelekas et al., 2010; Frillingos, 2012); based on homology modeling, Asp276 can H-bond with the substrate-binding Glu272 (Karena and Frillingos, 2011) and contributes to a H-bond network between Asn93-Glu272-Asp276 which might be important for the XanQ specificity (Karena et al., 2015). <strong>Met274 in UacT. </strong>Replacement by Asp leads to abolishment of the protein levels in the membrane (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012). <strong><em>Asp360 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> can be replaced by Ala with retention of low but significant transport activity and similar affinity and specificity properties to wild-type; D360A is also relatively stable in the plasma membrane; replacement by His results in a loss-of-function mutant which is localized in the plasma membrane but shows increased vacuolar turnover (Kosti et al., 2012).</p>

    <p><strong>M8.16: Ile277 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less background) leads to low protein levels in the membrane and essentially no activity (5% of wild-type); replacement by Leu results in normal membrane protein levels and normal xanthine transport activity (Mermelekas et al., 2010).&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>M8.17: Thr278 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) leads to abolishment of the protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Asn, Gln, Val or Gly results in significant but rather low xanthine transport activity (30-50% of wild-type); replacement by Ala or Ser results in normal xanthine transport activity, not differing from wild-type; all of the active mutants display normal protein levels in the membrane, except T278V which shows low but significant levels; reshuffling the order of residues 278-281 in quadruple mutant T278A/A279T/T280A/A281T results in low membrane protein levels and abolishment of the transport activity (Mermelekas et al., 2010).&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>M8.18: Ala279 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) or Val leads to abolishment of the protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Asn leads to inactivation although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Thr, Ser or Gly allows xanthine transport activity that is 40%, 80% or 100% of wild-type, respectively, without affecting the protein levels in the membrane; reshuffling the order of residues 278-281 in quadruple mutant T278A/A279T/T280A/A281T results in low protein levels in the membrane and abolishment of transport activity (Mermelekas et al., 2010). <strong><em>Ala363 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> was proposed to belong (together with Asp360 and key residues from TM10 and TM12) to a cytoplasm-facing substrate trajectory from the binding site to the cytoplasm (Kosti et al., 2012); mutation <em>uapA24</em> that had been used in genetic studies as a standard loss-of-function allele resulting in total loss of UapA-dependent transport was found to have a G-to-A transition changing Ala363 to Asp (Diallinas et al., 1998); analysis of <em>uapA24</em> and of <em>uapA24</em> revertants allowing restoration of growth on uric acid confirmed that Ala363 is irreplaceable by Asp but can be replaced by Gly with retention of wild-type transport activity (Diallinas et al., 1998; note that Ala363 is referred to in this paper as Ala404 because the amino-acid numbering used at that time was wrong, as revised later [see Koukaki et al., 2005]).</p>

    <p><strong>M8.19: Thr280 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) or Asn leads to abolishment of the protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Val leads to low protein levels and abolishment of the transport activity; replacement by Gln leads to inactivation although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Ser or Ala leads to normal protein levels and almost wild-type transport activity; replacement by Gly leads to compromised protein levels and transport activity (40% of wild-type) (Mermelekas et al., 2010); replacement by Leu lead to normal membrane protein levels and high transport activity with no significant difference in affinity for xanthine or specificity from wild type (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012); reshuffling the order of residues 278-281 in quadruple mutant T278A/A279T/T280A/A281T results in low membrane protein levels and abolishment of the transport activity (Mermelekas et al., 2010).&nbsp; <strong>Leu278 in UacT.</strong> Replacement by Thr leads to high uric acid uptake activity and marginal xanthine uptake (detectable only at 37°C), not differing significantly from wild type (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012).</p>

    <p><strong>M8.20: Ala281 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) leads to abolishment of the protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Val, Asn, Thr, Ser or Gly results in high or moderate (A281T) xanthine transport activity without affecting the membrane protein levels; reshuffling the order of residues 278-281 in mutant T278A/A279T/T280A/A281T results in low membrane protein levels and abolishment of the transport activity (Mermelekas et al., 2010).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M9</h4>

    <p><strong>M9.10: Asp304 in XanQ. </strong>Crucial in a H-bond network connecting TM2, TM9, β3 and β10 in XanQ between Gln75 (TM2), Asp304 (TM9), Gln90 (β3) and Thr321 (β10), shown to be essential for the protein stability and function by the analysis of single and combinatorial mutations at Gln75 and Asp304. Gln75 and Asp304 are central in this network as they can form H-bonds with all other partners (Karena et al., 2015). Replacement of Asp304 by Cys, Glu or Asn results in inactivation although retaining high protein levels in the membrane (Karena and Frillingos, 2009). Combinatorial replacement with Asn430 in mutants D304E/N430C or D304N/N430C also results in inactivation although retaining normal protein levels (Karena and Frillingos, 2009). Combinatorial replacement with Gln75 (individually irreplaceable) in mutant Q75N/D304E rescues significant transport activity (35% of wild type) but with 3- to 5-fold lower affinity for xanthine and oxypurinol (Karena et al., 2015). <strong>Asp298 in UacT. </strong>Functionally irreplaceable: replacement by Glu or Asn leads to inactivation although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012). <strong><em>Asp388 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> is also functionally irreplaceable by Glu or Asn: D388N leads to loss of the transport activity without affecting the plasma membrane localization of UapA; D388E appears to be entrapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (Papageorgiou et al., 2008); combinatorial replacement of Asp388 by Asn or Glu and Thr526 by Leu or Phe528 by Ala also leads to inactive mutants, that are normally localized in the plasma membrane (D388N/T526M, D388N/F528A) or retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (D388E/ F528A) (Papageorgiou et al., 2008).</p>

    <p><strong>M9.11: Gly305 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints, affecting the protein expression/stability in the membrane: replacement by Cys (in either a Cys-less or a wild-type permease background) results in abolishment of the protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Pro also leads to abolishment of the membrane protein levels; replacement by Ala results in normal membrane protein levels and highly significant xanthine transport activity (50% of wild-type) (Mermelekas et al., 2010).&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M10</h4>

    <p><strong>M10.1: Pro318 in XanQ.</strong> Crucial for proper folding/insertion in the membrane; replacement by Cys or Gly leads to abolishment of the membrane protein levels and of any xanthine transport activity (Karatza et al., 2006); Pro318 may be needed to control the protein fold through dictating architecture of TM10; the same is true of Gly83 for TM3 (Karena and Frillingos, 2011). Based on homology modeling and the overall mutagenesis of XanQ, the key folds of TM3 and TM10 in the core domain are sensitive to disruption by abrogating flexibility at Gly83 or rigidity at Pro318, which, in turn, destabilizes the structure (Karena and Frillingos, 2011; Frillingos, 2012).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.3: Thr320 in XanQ.</strong> Replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) results in very low xanthine transport activity (10% of Cys-less) without affecting the XanQ protein levels in the membrane (Karatza et al., 2006); based on homology modeling and induced-fit docking, Thr320 is peripheral to the substrate binding site and contributes to the H-bond network between Asn93-Ser95-Glu272-Asp276 via a H-bond of its hydroxyl group with Glu272 (carboxyl group) (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.4: Thr321 in XanQ.</strong> It contributes to a H-bond network connecting TM2, TM9, β3 and β10 in XanQ between Gln75 (TM2), Asp304 (TM9), Gln90 (β3) and Thr321 (β10), shown to be essential for the protein stability and function (Karena et al., 2015); replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) results in very low xanthine transport activity (20% of Cys-less) without affecting the protein levels of XanQ in the membrane (Karatza et al., 2006); the activity of T321C is inhibited by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (IC<sub>50</sub> about 1 mM) (Karatza et al., 2006; Georgopoulou et al., 2010) and this inhibition effect is reduced in the presence of substrate (1 mM xanthine) (Georgopoulou et al., 2010).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.5: Phe322 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable by Cys without affecting the protein levels in the membrane and with retention of high xanthine transport activity (wild-type background) or very low activity (Cys-less background) (Karatza et al., 2006); the transport activity of F322C is inhibited by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.4 mM) (Karatza et al., 2006) and this inhibition effect is unaffected by substrate (Georgopoulou et al., 2010); based on homology modeling and induced-fit docking, Phe322 contributes to substrate binding by van der Waals and aromatic packing interactions (Karena et al., 2015). <strong><em>Phe406 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> shows similar binding interactions; replacement of Phe406 by Tyr results in wild-type growth and transport characteristics, without major changes in specificity profile with respect to purines; however, the combined replacement F406Y with F528S at TM14 results in expansion of the substrate profile based on the observed ability to grow on adenine and hypoxanthine and recognition of uracil (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.3 mM) in xanthine transport competition assays (Kosti et al., 2010).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.6: Ala323 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) results in high xanthine transport activity that is sensitive to inhibition by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (IC<sub>50</sub> ≈30 μM) (Karatza et al., 2006); the <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide inhibition effect (IC<sub>50</sub> 34 μΜ) is enhanced by substrate (IC<sub>50</sub> 14 μΜ in the presence of 1 mM xanthine) (Georgopoulou et al., 2010); single-Cys A323C is highly reactive with both <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide and MTSES<sup>‒</sup>; the reactivity of A323C with either one of these SH-reagents does not change significantly in the presence of substrate (1 mM xanthine) at the experimental conditions employed (Georgopoulou et al., 2010); replacement by Ser results in high xanthine transport activity with compromised affinity for xanthine (3-fold increased <em>K</em><sub>m</sub>) but no significant changes in specificity (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012); based on homology modeling and induced-fit docking, Ala323 contributes to substrate binding via a H-bond from its backbone amide nitrogen (Karena et al., 2015). <strong>Ser317 in UacT.</strong> Replacement by Ala results in a mutant that does not differ significantly from wild-type in transport activity and affinity for uric acid but affects specificity, since it allows significant transport of xanthine above the wild-type UacT threshold (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012). <strong><em>Ala407 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> also confers to substrate binding via a H-bond from its backbone amide nitrogen to C6=O of xanthine (Alguel et al., 2016).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.7: Gln324 in XanQ. </strong>Functionally essential, crucial for the substrate binding affinity: replacement by Asn, Asp, Pro, Ala or Cys leads to inactivation or very low activity (Q324E, Q324N) without affecting the protein levels in the membrane; the low-activity mutants Q324E and Q324N are grossly impaired in affinity for xanthine (15-fold increased <em>K</em><sub>m</sub> relative to wild type) and all xanthine analogs that are ligands in wild-type XanQ (undetectable inhibitory effect of these analogs on xanthine uptake by Q324E or Q324N) (Karatza et al., 2006); single-Cys Q324C reacts with <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide or the <em>hydrophilic</em> MTSES<sup>‒</sup> (2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate) but the reaction is unaffected in the presence of xanthine, indicating that this mutant is also unable to bind xanthine with significant affinity (Georgopoulou et al., 2010); based on homology modeling, Gln324 interacts directly with xanthine in the binding site via a bidentate H-bond between the Gln324 side chain amide and the N1H and C2=O of xanthine (Karena et al., 2015). <strong>Gln318 in UacT.</strong> Functionally essential: replacement by Glu or Asn leads to inactivation although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012).<strong> <em>Gln408 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> is also functionally essential and crucial for substrate binding affinity: replacement by Asn results in a mutant that allows growth on xanthine or uric acid and low xanthine transport activity, but with substantially reduced affinity for both xanthine and uric acid (8-fold increased <em>Κ</em><sub>m</sub> values) and impaired affinity for the majority of xanthine/uric acid analogs that are recognized by wild type (Koukaki et al., 2005); replacement by Ala, Pro, Glu, or Ser results in marginal or no xanthine transport activity (single-copy transformants) that is increased to measurable <em>albeit low</em> levels only in multicopy transformants; these mutants are also cryosensitive (growth and transport of substrates are observed at 37°C but not at 25°C); Q408E and Q408P do not affect the UapA targeting to the plasma membrane; Q408E, Q408P and Q408S show no growth on 0.5 mM xanthine or uric acid but allow growth at 1-2 mM (Koukaki et al., 2005); based on analysis of the multicopy transformants, Q408P, Q408S and Q408A show impaired affinity for both uric acid and xanthine, whereas Q408E shows decreased but significant affinity for both substrates (2- to 3-fold increased <em>Κ</em><sub>m</sub> values) and effects on specificity indicated by the loss of affinity for certain analogs (8-methylxanthine, oxypurinol) and a novel property to recognize hypoxanthine (<em>Κ</em><sub>i</sub> 71 μΜ) and guanine (<em>Κ</em><sub>i</sub> 60 μΜ) (Koukaki et al., 2005); combinatorial replacement of Gln408 by Glu and Thr526 by Met or Leu (Q408E/T526M, Q408E/T526L) (Papageorgiou et al., 2008) or Phe528 by Ser (Q408E/F528S) (Amillis et al., 2001), Thr (Q408E/F528T) or Ala (Q408E/F528A) (Vlanti et al., 2006), or both Thr526 by Met or Phe528 by Ser and Arg481 by Gly (Q408E/R481G/T526M, Q408E/R481G/F528S) (Alguel et al., 2016) leads to further effects on specificity, as indicated by improved recognition of the non-canonical substrates hypoxanthine (Q408E/T526L, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 10 μM; Q408E/T526M, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 16 μM; Q408E/R481G/T526M, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 24 μM), guanine (Q408E/T526M, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 10 μM; Q408E/T526L, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 20 μM), adenine (Q408E/R481G/T526M, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 83 μM; Q408E/F528T, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 146 μΜ; Q408E/F528S, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 225 μΜ; Q408E/R481G/F528S, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 188 μM; Q408E/F528A, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 200 μΜ), and decreases in affinity for uric acid (Q408E/F528T, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 151 μΜ; Q408E/F528A, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 88 μΜ; Q408E/T526L, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 35 μM; Q408E/R481G/T526M, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 64 μM; Q408E/R481G/F528S, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 39 μM); these changes may reflect interaction of Q408E (at the binding site) with other, distinct, sites, acting as “selectivity gates” that influence specificity through controlling the access of substrates to the binding site (Diallinas, 2014); combinatorial replacement of Q408E with changes at other positions result in milder effects on specificity (Q408E/A469E) (Alguel et al., 2016), minor overall effects (Q113L/Q408E), or loss-of-function mutants (E356Q/Q408E) (Papageorgiou et al., 2008); mutant strains co-expressing Q408E or Q408P with wild-type UapA display reduced xanthine uptake relative to wild-type control without affecting the <em>Κ</em><sub>m</sub> for xanthine but allowing (in Q408E/wt) partial inhibition by hypoxanthine: the data were interpreted to support the notion that dimerization of UapA is required for function (Alguel et al., 2016); Gln408 interacts directly with xanthine in the binding site via a bidentate H-bond with N1H and C2=O of xanthine (Alguel et al., 2016).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.8: Asn325 in XanQ. </strong>Functionally irreplaceable: replacement by Gln, Ala, Ser, Asp, Thr or Cys leads to inactivation although retaining normal or compromised but significant (N325Q) protein levels in the membrane (Karatza et al., 2006); single-Cys N325C reacts with <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide or MTSES<sup>‒</sup> and the reaction is hindered in the presence of substrate (xanthine), indicating involvement of Asn325 in the substrate binding site (Georgopoulou et al., 2010); based on homology modeling, Asn325 can form a H-bond with His31 at the periphery of the binding site (Frillingos, 2012). <strong>Asn319 in UacT.</strong> Functionally irreplaceable: replacement by Asp or Gln leads to inactivation although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012).<strong> <em>Asn409 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> is functionally irreplaceable by Ala or Asp but replacement by Ser or Gln results in high transport activity; N409A also shows significant <em>albeit low</em> transport activity when expressed from multicopy transformants (Koukaki et al., 2005); kinetic analysis indicates that N409A, N409Q and N409S do not differ significantly from wild type in affinity for xanthine, uric acid or their analogs, apart from minor changes (Koukaki et al., 2005); these mutants are also cryosensitive (growth and transport of substrates are observed at 37°C but not at 25°C) (Koukaki et al., 2005); combinatorial replacement of Asn409 by Ala or Asp and Thr526 by Leu or Phe528 by Ala yields mutants (N409A/T526L, N409A/F528A, N409D/F528A) that restore partial UapA activity with significant effects on specificity, allowing increased affinity for several xanthine analogs but no changes in affinity or kinetics for uric acid or xanthine; combinatorial replacement of Asn409 by Asp and Glu356 by Gln (E356Q/N409D) does not rescue any transport activity (Papageorgiou et al., 2008); mutant strains co-expressing (the loss-of-function) N409D with wild-type UapA display reduced xanthine uptake relative to wild-type control without affecting the <em>Κ</em><sub>m</sub> for xanthine: the data were interpreted to support the notion that dimerization of UapA is required for function (Alguel et al., 2016); Asn409 can form a H-bond with His86 at the periphery of the binding site (Alguel et al., 2016); the phenomenon of UapA endocytosis and turnover elicited by substrate (uric acid) binding is not observed in the loss-of-function mutant N409D (Gournas et al., 2010).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.9: Asn326 in XanQ. </strong>Replacement by Cys (in the wild-type background) results in normal protein levels in the membrane and high xanthine transport activity that is sensitive to inhibition by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (IC<sub>50</sub> 50 μΜ) (Karatza et al., 2006); the sensitivity of N326C(wt) to <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide remains unaffected in the presence of substrate (xanthine) (Georgopoulou et al., 2010); replacement by Cys in the Cys-less permease background results in marginal activity although retaining normal XanQ protein levels (Karatza et al., 2006); single-Cys N326C reacts with <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide or MTSES<sup>‒</sup> and the reaction is unaffected in the presence of substrate (xanthine) (Georgopoulou et al., 2010). <strong>Val320 in UacT.</strong> Replacement by Asn results in abolishment of any detectable transport activity for uric acid or xanthine, although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.10: Gly327 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable by Ala, Cys, or Pro with retention of high xanthine transport activity not differing significantly from wild type in kinetics, specificity or affinity for xanthine; replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) results in high xanthine transport activity that is sensitive to inhibition by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (Karatza et al., 2006); the <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide inhibition effect (IC<sub>50</sub> 10 μΜ) and the reactivity of single-Cys G327C with <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide are not altered by substrate (xanthine) (Georgopoulou et al., 2010); single-Cys G327C is also highly reactive with MTSES<sup>‒</sup> and sensitive to inactivation by MTSES<sup>‒</sup> in the presence or absence of substrate (Georgopoulou et al., 2010). <strong><em>Gly411 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> is replaceable by Ala or Pro with retention of high xanthine transport activity (2-fold higher than wild-type) but substantially reduced affinity for uric acid (G411P; <em>K</em><sub>m</sub> 76 μΜ) or both uric acid and xanthine (G411A; <em>K</em><sub>m</sub> 0.32 mΜ and 0.16 mM, respectively), whereas replacement by Val lead to a loss-of-function mutant without affecting the protein targeting to the plasma membrane (Koukaki et al., 2005); G411A displays impaired affinity not only for uric acid and xanthine but also for oxypurinol; G411P shows decreased affinity for uric acid but increased affinity for xanthine, oxypurinol and several other analogs; G411A and G411P appear to be able to use hypoxanthine (2 mM, but not 0.5 mM) as a nitrogen source in growth assays (Koukaki et al., 2005); G411V as well as an N-terminally truncated version of G411V (G411V<sub>Δ1-11</sub>) show improved stability relative to UapA or several single-replacement UapA mutants, as judged from FSEC (fluorescent size exclusion chromatography) analysis after expression of GFP-tagged UapA constructs in <em>S. cerevisiae </em>FGY217, purification, and solubilization in 1% DDM or NG with or without 1 mM xanthine (Leung et al., 2013); G411V<sub>Δ1-11</sub> was preferred over G411V for downstream structural studies, based on large-scale expression, purification, and long-term stability analysis (Leung et al., 2013; Alguel et al., 2016); mutant strains co-expressing (the loss-of-function) G411V with wild-type UapA display reduced xanthine uptake relative to wild-type control without affecting the <em>Κ</em><sub>m</sub> for xanthine: the data were interpreted to support the notion that dimerization of UapA is required for function (Alguel et al., 2016).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.11: Val328 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) with retention of high xanthine transport activity that is sensitive to inhibition by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (Karatza et al., 2006); the <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide inhibition effect (IC<sub>50</sub> 96 μΜ) and the reactivity of single-Cys V328C with <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide are not altered significantly by substrate (xanthine) (Georgopoulou et al., 2010); single-Cys V328C is also reactive with MTSES<sup>‒</sup> and sensitive to inactivation by MTSES<sup>‒</sup> in the presence or absence of substrate (Georgopoulou et al., 2010).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.12: Ile329 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) with retention of normal protein levels but low xanthine transport activity (15-20% of Cys-less) that is sensitive to inhibition by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (Karatza et al., 2006); the <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide inhibition effect (IC<sub>50</sub> 50 μΜ) is not altered in the presence of substrate (xanthine) (Georgopoulou et al., 2010).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.15: Thr332 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Asn or Ala results in high or moderate xanthine transport activity, respectively, whereas replacement by Cys or Asp results in very low transport activity (15% of wild-type) although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane; T332N and T332A do not differ significantly from wild-type in affinity for xanthine but T332N differs in specificity, showing ability to recognize 8-methylxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.2 mM), increased affinity for 2-thio- and 3-methylxanthine, and reduced affinity for 1-methyl- and 6-thioxanthine (Karatza et al., 2006); replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less background) results in low transport activity (15% of Cys-less) that is sensitive to inhibition by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (Karatza et al., 2006); the <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide inhibition effect (IC<sub>50</sub> 40 μΜ) is not altered in the presence of substrate (xanthine) (Georgopoulou et al., 2010). <strong><em>Thr416 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> is replaceable by Ala or Ser with retention of high or moderate xanthine transport activity not differing significantly from wild type in affinity for xanthine, uric acid or analogs; replacement by Asp results in high activity that is also similar in affinity for substrates or specificity with wild-type UapA, but is only detected at 37°C in high-copy transformants; replacement by Asn results in moderate xanthine transport activity but decreased affinity for xanthine (<em>K</em><sub>m</sub> 36 μΜ), impaired affinity for uric acid (<em>K</em><sub>m</sub> 0.37 mΜ) and complete loss of affinity for most xanthine/uric acid analogs (except 3-methyl-, 8-methyl-, and 2-thioxanthine) (Koukaki et al., 2005); Thr416 was proposed to belong (together with Arg417 and key residues from TM8 and TM12) to a cytoplasm-facing substrate trajectory from the binding site to the cytoplasm (Kosti et al., 2012).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.16: Gly333 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys or Arg results in high or moderate xanthine transport activity, respectively, whereas replacement by Lys results in low transport activity (15% of wild-type) although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane; G333R and G333K do not differ significantly from wild-type in affinity for xanthine but G333R differs in specificity, showing ability to recognize 8-methylxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.4 mM), 7-methylxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.1 mM) and, marginally, uric acid (<em>K</em><sub>i </sub>0.75 mM) (Karatza et al., 2006); replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less background) results in high transport activity that is sensitive to inhibition by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (Karatza et al., 2006); the <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide effect (IC<sub>50</sub> 35 μΜ) is unaltered in the presence of substrate (xanthine) (Georgopoulou et al., 2010); single-Cys G327C is also reactive and sensitive to inhibition by MTSES<sup>‒</sup> in the presence or absence of substrate (Georgopoulou et al., 2010). <strong>Arg327 in UacT. </strong>Replacement by Gly results in high uric acid uptake activity and marginal xanthine uptake, not differing significantly from wild-type UacT (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012). <strong><em>Arg417 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> is replaceable by Gly or Lys with retention of high xanthine transport activity and high affinity for both uric acid and xanthine (R417K) or high affinity for xanthine and decreased affinity (<em>K</em><sub>m</sub> 92 μΜ) for uric acid (R417G); R417G also shows reduced affinity for some xanthine/uric acid analogs (oxypurinol, 8-azaxanthine) (Koukaki et al., 2005); Arg417 was proposed to belong (together with Thr416 and key residues from TM8 and TM12) to a cytoplasm-facing substrate trajectory from the binding site to the cytoplasm (Kosti et al., 2012).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M11</h4>

    <p><strong>M11.1: Gly340 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints, affecting the protein expression/stability in the membrane: replacement by Cys (in either a Cys-less or a wild-type permease background) leads to abolishment of the protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Ala leads to low protein levels in the membrane and low but significant xanthine uptake activity (40% of wild-type) (Karatza et al., 2006).</p>

    <p><strong>M11.12: Gly351 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints, affecting the protein expression/stability in the membrane: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) or Pro results in abolishment of the protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Ala results in low membrane protein levels and low but significant xanthine transport activity (30-40% of wild-type) (Mermelekas et al., 2010).&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>M11.15: Pro354 in XanQ.</strong> Important for folding/insertion/stability of the protein: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) results in abolishment of the protein levels in the membrane; however, replacement by Gly results in high protein levels in the membrane but low xanthine transport activity (20% of wild-type) (Mermelekas et al., 2010).&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M12</h4>

    <p><strong>M12.6: Leu368 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) results in abolishment of the protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Ala results in low xanthine transport activity (15% of wild-type) although retaining high protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Ile results in high transport activity, indistinguishable from wild type in affinity for xanthine or specificity for xanthine analogs (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M12.7: Gly369 in XanQ.</strong> Irreplaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) or Ala; G369A and single-Cys G369C are inactive although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane; flexibility of Gly369 (as well as of Gly370 and Gly383) at the interface between TM12 and core domain may be needed in the alternating access mechanism (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M12.8: Gly370 in XanQ.</strong> Irreplaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) or Ala; G370A and single-Cys G370C are inactive although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane; flexibility of Gly370 (as well as of Gly369 and Gly383) at the interface between TM12 and core domain may be needed in the alternating access mechanism (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M12.13: Met375 in XanQ.</strong> Replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less background) yields a permease with low xanthine transport activity (low affinity; <em>K</em><sub>m</sub> 4-fold higher than Cys-less) which is increased 6-fold by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide resulting in restoration of normal activity, when assays are performed with 1 μΜ xanthine; a bulky side chain is probably needed for high activity/affinity and the maleimide adduct may restore the original side-chain volume (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M12.14: Phe376 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) results in very low transport activity (15% of Cys-less) although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Leu or Tyr results in moderate or high xanthine transport activity, respectively, not differing from wild type in affinity for xanthine or specificity for xanthine analogs (Karena et al., 2015); based on homology modeling and induced-fit docking on the template of the inward-open conformation of UraA (Lu et al., 2011), Phe376 shows π-π stacking interactions with the substrate (xanthine or oxypurinol) and the amide group of the side chain of Gln324 (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M12.15: Ser377 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) results in high xanthine transport activity that is inhibited by 65% by 2 mM <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide; replacement by Ala also results in high transport activity; S377C and S377A do not differ in affinity or specificity from wild type; however, replacement by Thr leads to inactivation although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M12.17: <em>Val463 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> was proposed to belong (together with Ala469 and key residues from TM8 and TM10) to a cytoplasm-facing substrate trajectory from the binding site to the cytoplasm (Kosti at el., 2012); mutation V463I was isolated in a genetic screen for second-site modulators of F528S (expanding further the broad specificity profile of F528S), allowing growth on 0.5 mM adenine (<em>and</em> on 0.5 mM hypoxanthine); in addition, V463I/F528S allows low-affinity recognition of uracil (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.4 mM); V463I recognizes with low affinity uracil (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.3 mM), guanine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.7 mM) and hypoxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.9 mM) (Kosti et al., 2010).</p>

    <p><strong>M12.21: Gly383 in XanQ.</strong> Irreplaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less background) or Ala; G383A is inactive although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane whereas G383C displays marginally detectable membrane protein levels; flexibility of Gly383 is revealed by a propensity to disorient the α-helix secondary structure of TM12 at this position during molecular dynamics trajectories (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <h4>Motif M13</h4>

    <p><strong>M13.5: <em>Arg481 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> is associated with specificity; mutations R481G, R481L and R481Q were isolated in a genetic screen for second-site modulators of F528S (expanding further the broad specificity profile of F528S), allowing growth on 0.5 mM adenine (<em>and</em> 0.5 mM hypoxanthine); R481-mutants corresponded to 20 out of the 28 unbiased second-site mutations enabling usage of these non-canonical substrates (Kosti at el., 2010); in addition, mutants R481G/F528S, R481L/F528S and R481Q/F528S allowed recognition of uracil (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> values from 35 to 113 μM); less prominent effects were seen with the single mutants R481G, R481L and R481Q; more pronounced effects were found with the engineered mutants Q113L/R481G and, especially, R481G/T526M, showing affinity for non-canonical substrates and increased affinity for most UapA ligands: R481G/T526M displays high affinity for uracil (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 32 μM), moderate affinity for hypoxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.18 mM), guanine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.22 mM), low but measurable affinity for adenine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.98 mM) and increased affinity for xanthine, oxypurinol and nearly all xanthine analogs tested (Kosti et al., 2010); combination of the R481G/T526M mutations with replacement of Gln408 by Glu (Q408E/R481G/T526M) results in further enlargement of specificity, leading to reduced affinity for uric acid (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 39 μΜ) and enhanced, high-affinity recognition of hypoxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 24 μΜ) and adenine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 83 μΜ) (Alguel et al., 2016); combinatorial replacement of R481G/F528S with Q408E (Q408E/R481G/F528S) leads to a similar effect, showing reduced affinity for xanthine (<em>K</em><sub>m</sub> 21 μΜ) and uric acid (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 64 μΜ) and significant recognition of hypoxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.15 mΜ) and adenine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.19 mΜ) (Alguel et al., 2016); deletion of Arg481 (ΔR481) or relocation of its position in loop 10-11 by introducing a Ala-Gly spacer (AGR481) leads to misfolding/instability and partial ER-retention associated with vacuolar turnover (Kosti et al., 2010); ΔR481 is degraded by both ER-associated degradation and non-endocytic vacuolar turnover, that occurs prior to localization in the plasma membrane via selective autophagy or sorting from the Golgi to the vacuole (Evangelinos et al., 2016); based on the dimeric UapA crystal structure (PDB ID: 5I6C) and molecular dynamics simulations, Arg481 of the one protomer is predicted to approach the central binding cavity of the other protomer in the course of the mechanism: this can create a specificity barrier on the pathway to the cytoplasm with the substrate (xanthine) forming transient H-bond and π–π interactions with Arg481 before moving in the cytosol with reorientation of the Arg481 side chain and disruption of these interactions (Alguel et al., 2016).</p>

    <p><strong>M13.12: Leu404 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with severe constraints: replacement by Ala inactivates and replacement by Ile leads to very low activity (10% of wild-type) without affecting the protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less background) leads to low xanthine transport activity (25% of Cys-less) which is increased 4-fold by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide resulting in restoration of activity; a bulky side chain might be needed for high activity and the maleimide adduct may restore the original side-chain volume (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M13.14: Leu406 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Ala leads to abolishment of xanthine transport activity although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane; replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less background) or Ile results in moderate or high xanthine transport activity, respectively, and the activity of single-Cys L406C is unaffected by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <p><strong>M3.17: Gly409 in XanQ.</strong> Irreplaceable by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) or Ala; G409A and single-Cys G409C are inactive although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane (Karena et al., 2015).</p>

    <h4>Motif M14</h4>

    <p><strong>M14.2: Asn430 in XanQ. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) results in high xanthine transport activity that is strongly inhibited by <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (IC<sub>50</sub> 10 μM) and N430C is protected from the <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide inhibition effect in the presence of substrate (2-thioxanthine, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.15 mM); single-Cys N430C does not differ significantly in affinity for xanthine and transport kinetics from Cys-less XanQ (Papakostas et al., 2008); replacement by Thr results in retention of high protein levels in the membrane but abolishment of the transport activity (Papakostas et al., 2008); replacement by Ser results in very low xanthine transport activity (10-15% of wild-type) although retaining high protein levels in the membrane; N430S does not display any detectable difference in specificity from wild type (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012); re-introduction of Asn430 or Ile432 in place of Thr or Phe, respectively, in an inactive XanQ(N<sub>13</sub>)/UapA(C<sub>1</sub>) chimera that is expressed in the membrane poorly leads to improvement of expression/stability, whereas re-introduction of both Asn and Ile leads to normal membrane protein levels and significant transport activity (Papakostas et al., 2008). <strong>Ser426 in UacT. </strong>Replacement by Asn results in high uric acid uptake activity and marginal xanthine uptake, not differing significantly from wild-type UacT (Papakostas and Frillingos, 2012). <strong><em>Thr526 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> is associated with specificity; based on a genetic screen for mutants utilizing adenine, it was found that replacing Thr526 to Leu or Met results in high xanthine transport activity without significant changes in affinity for xanthine or uric acid but increased affinity for some analogs and ability to grow on non-canonical substrates, adenine and hypoxanthine, that was most evident at high concentration (2 mM) and at 25°C rather than at 37°C (Papageorgiou et al., 2008); replacement of Thr526 by Ala, Ser or Thr resulted in high xanthine transport activity with no changes in affinity for xanthine or uric acid, detectable but less evident increases in affinity for analogs, and no evidence for utilization of adenine or hypoxanthine in growth assays (Papageorgiou et al., 2008); combinatorial replacement of Thr526 by Leu and Asn409 by Ala (N409A/T526L) restores partial UapA activity (N409A is inactive) with effects on specificity, allowing growth on adenine and hypoxanthine, increased affinity for several xanthine analogs, but no changes in affinity or kinetics for uric acid or xanthine; combinatorial replacement of Thr526 by Met or Leu and Gln408 by Glu (Q408E/T526M, Q408E/T526L) leads to low but significant xanthine transport activity with high affinity for both uric acid and xanthine, ability to grow on adenine and hypoxanthine, and high-affinity recognition of both hypoxanthine and guanine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> values from 10 μΜ to 34 μM) (Papageorgiou et al., 2008); combining T526L or T526M with replacements in other sites leads to inactivation (D388N/T526M; indistinguishable from D388N), very low transport activity with retention of high affinity for xanthine and uric acid, and recognition of non-canonical substrates (E356D/T526M), or high xanthine transport activity with affinity for non-canonical substrates (uracil, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 19 μM; hypoxanthine, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.26 mM; guanine, <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.5 mM) and increased affinity for xanthine, oxypurinol and nearly all xanthine analogs tested (Q113L/T526L) (Papageorgiou et al., 2008); similarly, R481G/T526M retains high affinity for uric acid and xanthine and xanthine transport activity but also displays high affinity for uracil (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 32 μM), moderate affinity for hypoxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.18 mM), guanine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.22 mM), low but measurable affinity for adenine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.98 mM) and increased affinity for xanthine, oxypurinol and nearly all xanthine analogs tested (Kosti et al., 2010); combinatorial replacement of Thr526 by Met, Arg481 by Gly and Gln408 by Glu (Q408E/R481G/T526M) leads to reduced affinity for uric acid (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 39 μΜ) and high-affinity recognition of non-canonical substrates, hypoxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 24 μΜ) and adenine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 83 μΜ) (Alguel et al., 2016); the above changes imply that Thr526 is involved in specificity through interactions with other residues; the combinatorial effects may reflect interactions of T526M/L with Q408E or N409A (at the binding site) and other mutations at distinct sites, acting as “selectivity gates” that influence specificity through controlling the access of substrates to the binding site; based on extensive docking analysis and molecular dynamics, Thr526 is distant from the binding site but might belong to an outward-facing gate leading towards the substrate binding site (Kosti et al., 2012).</p>

    <p><strong>M14.4: Ile432 in XanQ.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by bulkier amino acids (Phe, Trp) or Glu leads to inactivation without affecting the membrane protein levels; replacement by Leu or Met results in significant transport activity but only in the Cys-less permease background; replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less background) leads to very low membrane protein levels and no transport activity; replacement by Gln or Asn results in high xanthine transport activity, not differing in kinetics from wild-type; replacement by smaller amino acids (Ala, Ser, Thr) or Val results in low but significant activity, with minor effects on kinetics (lower affinity for xanthine in I432V); most of the active mutants display decreased affinities for some analogs (1-methyl-, 3-methyl-, 6-thioxanthine) but no changes in specificity (Papakostas et al., 2008); combinatorial replacement of Ile432 with Ser and Gln324 (TM10) with Asn or Glu corrects the impaired affinity of Q324N or Q324E for xanthine but does not improve the low transport efficiency of the Q324-mutants (Papakostas et al., 2008); re-introduction of Ile-432 or Asn-430 in place of Phe or Thr, respectively, in an inactive XanQ(N<sub>13</sub>)/UapA(C<sub>1</sub>) chimera that is expressed in the membrane poorly leads to improvement of expression/stability, whereas combinatorial re-introduction of the two residues leads to normal membrane protein levels and significant transport activity (Papakostas et al., 2008).<em> <strong>Phe528 in the fungal UapA</strong></em> is associated with specificity; mutation F528S was isolated in a genetic screen for second-site modulators of Q408E (rescuing Q408E from inability to transport UapA substrates at 25°C [Meintanis et al., 2000]) allowing growth on uric acid and xanthine at both 25°C and 37°C (Amillis et al., 2001); Q408E/F528S also showed increased ability for recognition/transport of hypoxanthine and other purine bases as well as uracil; F528S showed similar but less pronounced properties (Amillis et al., 2001; note that Phe528 and Gln408 are referred to in this paper as Phe569 and Gln449, respectively, because the amino-acid numbering used at that time was wrong, as revised later [see Koukaki et al., 2005]); detailed site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis revealed that replacement of Phe528 by Ala, Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr or Tyr leads to high xanthine transport activity without major changes in the UapA affinity for xanthine or uric acid (except F528Q, which shows impaired affinities: <em>K</em><sub>m</sub> 0.35 mM for xanthine; <em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.5 mM for uric acid) and no recognition of hypoxanthine or adenine in transport competition assays, although F528A or F528T could clearly grow on hypoxanthine (Vlanti et al., 2006); however, combinatorial replacement of Phe528 by Ala, Ser or Thr and Gln408 by Glu leads to low xanthine transport activity, recognition of both adenine and hypoxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> values from 0.13 mM to 0.28 mM) (Q408E/F528A, Q408E/F528S, Q408E/F528T) and decreased affinity for uric acid in the cases of Q408E/F528A and Q408E/F528T (Vlanti et al., 2006); combinations with replacement of Gln408 by Pro lead to negligible activity (indistinguishable from Q408P) (Q408P/F528A, Q408P/F528S) or high xanthine transport activity but reduced affinity for both xanthine (<em>K</em><sub>m</sub> 0.21 mM) and uric acid (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.13 mM) (Q408P/F528T) (Vlanti et al., 2006); combinatorial replacement of Phe528 by Ala and Asn409 by Ala or Asp (N409A/F528A, N409D/F528A) restores partial UapA activity (N409A/D alone is inactive) but also with effects on specificity, allowing increased affinity for several xanthine analogs without changes in affinity or kinetics for uric acid or xanthine (Papageorgiou et al., 2008); the double mutants D388E/F528A or D388N/F528A did not rescue any transport activity relative to the (inactive) D388E or D388N (Papageorgiou et al., 2008); a genetic screen for second-site modulators of F528S allowing growth on 0.5 mM adenine revealed additional double mutants (Q113L/F528S, F406Y/F528S, A441V/F528S, V463I/F528S, A469E/F528S, R481G/F528S, R481L/F528S, R481Q/F528S) that are able to grow on adenine and hypoxanthine and recognize non-canonical substrates such as uracil and, marginally, guanine and hypoxanthine, in competition assays, without changes in affinity for xanthine or uric acid (Kosti et al., 2010); combinatorial replacement of Phe528 by Ser, Arg481 by Gly and Gln408 by Glu (Q408E/R481G/F528S) leads to reduced affinity for xanthine (<em>K</em><sub>m</sub> 21 μΜ) and uric acid (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 64 μΜ) and significant recognition of non-canonical substrates, hypoxanthine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.15 mΜ) and adenine (<em>K</em><sub>i</sub> 0.19 mΜ) (Alguel et al., 2016); the above changes imply that Phe528 is involved in specificity through interactions with other residues; the combinatorial effects may reflect interactions of F528S/A with Q408E, F406Y or N409A/D (at the binding site) and other mutations at distinct sites, acting as “selectivity gates” that influence specificity through controlling the access of substrates to the binding site; based on extensive docking analysis and molecular dynamics, Phe528 is distant from the binding site but might belong to an outward-facing gate leading towards the substrate binding site (Kosti et al., 2012).</p>

    <p><strong>M14.8: Gly436 in XanQ. </strong>Replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less permease background) results in low xanthine transport activity (20% of Cys-less) although retaining normal protein levels in the membrane; however, replacement by Cys in the wild-type background results in retention of high xanthine transport activity, not differing significantly from wild type XanQ (Papakostas et al., 2008).</p>

    <p><strong>M14.15: Asn443 in XanQ. </strong>Replacement by Cys (in a Cys-less background) results in high xanthine transport activity that is inhibited by 50% by 2 mM <em>N</em>-ethylmaleimide (Papakostas et al., 2008). <strong><em>Asn539 in the fungal UapA</em></strong> is replaceable by Ala with retention of wild-type transport and specificity properties (Vlanti et al., 2006).</p>

    <h3>Importance of residues in motifs</h3>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M2</h4>

    <p><strong>M2.2:</strong> <strong>His24 in UraA. </strong>It interacts via an H-bond with Asn291 at the periphery of the binding site (Lu et al., 2011)</p>

    <p><strong>M2.9:</strong> <strong>Ala31 in UraA.</strong> It confers to uracil coordination at the binding site via van der Waals interactions (Lu et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2017)</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M3</h4>

    <p><strong>M3.15: Ser71 in UraA.</strong> It interacts with the uracil-binding Tyr288 (hydroxyl group) via two H-bonds from the backbone carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen atoms (Lu et al., 2011).</p>

    <p><strong>M3.16: Ser72 in UraA.</strong> Functionally replaceable but with restrictions: replacement of Ser72 by Ala or Thr yields active mutants with low transport capacity while replacement by Val abrogates uracil uptake (Botou et al., 2018). It confers to an H-bond network at the binding site involving also Glu241, the bound uracil, His245, and two water molecules between Ser72-Glu241 and Glu241-His245 (Yu et al., 2017). Its hydroxyl group forms an indirect H-bond with uracil mediated by a water molecule (Yu et al., 2017). <strong>Ser87 in RutG:</strong> Functionally replaceable but with restrictions: replacement by Ala or Thr yields active mutants with low uracil and thymine transport capacity while replacement by Val abrogates uracil and thymine uptake (Botou et al., 2018). &nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>M3.17: Phe73 in UraA.</strong> Important for the specificity of uracil/thymine distinction: mutant F73A retains the bulk of uracil uptake activity (Lu et al., 2011) but with reduced kinetic affinity (Botou et al., 2018) and also allows high-affinity recognition and transport of thymine (Botou et al., 2018). The double mutant F73A/G289A has very low uracil uptake activity (Botou et al., 2018). Phe73 confers to uracil binding via an H-bond from the backbone amide nitrogen and van der Waals interactions (Lu et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2017). It also blocks access to substrate from the outside environment in the inward-open (Lu et al., 2011) and the occluded conformations (Yu et al., 2017). Molecular docking indicates that thymine is excluded from the binding site of UraA due to steric hindrance of the C5-methyl group of thymine with Phe73 (Botou et al., 2018). <strong>Phe63 in AvDDG3: </strong>Important for the specificity of uracil/thymine distinction: mutant F63A retains the bulk of uracil uptake activity but also allows high-affinity recognition of thymine (Botou et al., 2018). <strong>Phe87 in AcS572: </strong>Important for the specificity of uracil/thymine distinction: mutant F87A (or F87A/G308A) retains the bulk of uracil uptake activity but also allows high-affinity recognition of thymine (Botou et al., 2018). <strong>Ala88 in RutG:</strong> Only RutG and the RutG orthologs from Enterobacteriales retain an Ala at this position; all other UraA homologs have Phe. The lack of Phe allows accommodation of thymine in the binding site and is linked with the broader specificity of RutG (Botou et al., 2018). Replacement of Ala88 by Phe in mutants A88F and A88F/A308G leads to compromised thymine uptake but does not restore a uracil-specific profile (Botou et al., 2018).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M5</h4>

    <p><strong>M5.10: Val129 in UraA. </strong>It confers to stabilization of the H-bond network between Glu241 and His245 through its backbone carbonyl oxygen (Yu et al., 2017).</p>

    <p><strong>M5.18: Ala137 in UraA. </strong>A double UraA mutant replacing the dimeric interface residues Ala137 and Ile374 with Trp yields a constitutive monomer that binds uracil normally but has no transport activity, suggesting that dimer formation is required for transport (Yu et al., 2017).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M8</h4>

    <p><strong>M8.9: Glu241 in UraA.</strong> Functionally essential: replacement of Glu241 by Ala abrogates uracil uptake and causes loss of uracil binding (Lu et al., 2011). It directly binds uracil with H-bonds from the one of the carboxylic oxygen atoms (Lu et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2017); the other carboxylic oxygen atom also interacts with uracil via a water-mediated H-bond (Yu et al., 2017). It is also suggested to be essential in proton coupling (Yu et al., 2017). It is central in an H-bond network involving also Ser72, the bound uracil, His245, and two water molecules between Ser72-Glu241 and Glu241-His245 (Yu et al., 2017). Molecular dynamics suggests that this H-bond network may provide the molecular basis for coupling the substrate transfer with proton translocation (Yu et al., 2017). A constitutive dimer with one wild-type UraA molecule covalently linked to a variant containing the loss-of-function E241A shows similar <em>K</em><sub>m</sub> and <em>V</em><sub>max</sub> to that of a wild-type/wild-type constitutive dimer, suggesting that UraA works as a dimer but one functional protomer is sufficient for substrate translocation (Yu et al., 2017). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>M8.13: His245 in UraA.</strong> Functionally essential: replacement of His245 by Ala, Arg, Asp or Val abrogates uracil uptake (Botou et al., 2018). Replacement by Ala abrogates uracil uptake and causes loss of uracil binding (Lu et al., 2011). It is suggested to play an important role in proton-coupling (Yu et al., 2017). It confers to an H-bond network at the binding site involving also Ser72, Glu241, the bound uracil, and two water molecules between Ser72-Glu241 and Glu241-His245 (Yu et al., 2017). Molecular dynamics suggests that this H-bond network may provide the molecular basis for coupling the substrate transfer with proton translocation (Yu et al., 2017). A constitutive dimer with one wild-type UraA molecule covalently linked to a variant containing the loss-of-function H245A shows similar <em>K</em><sub>m</sub> and <em>V</em><sub>max</sub> to that of a wild-type/wild-type constitutive dimer, suggesting that UraA works as a dimer but one functional protomer is sufficient for substrate translocation (Yu et al., 2017). <strong>His266 in RutG: </strong>Functionally essential: replacement of His266 by Ala, Arg, Asp or Val abrogates uracil and thymine uptake (Botou et al., 2018).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M9</h4>

    <p><strong>M9.17: Asn270 in UraA. </strong>It is central in an extensive H-bond network in the middle of the core domain involving also other polar residues from TM9 (Ser266, Ser273), TM8 (His242), β10 (Asn285) and TM2 (Asn50, Tyr57) (Lu et al., 2011). This H-bond network is topologically similar to an H-bond network connecting TM2, TM9, β3 and β10 in XanQ between Gln75 (TM2), Asp304 (TM9), Gln90 (β3) and Thr321 (β10), which has been shown to be essential for the protein stability and function by the analysis of single and combinatorial mutations at Gln75 and Asp304 (Karena et al., 2015).&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M10</h4>

    <p><strong>M10.8: Tyr288 in UraA. </strong>Replaceable: mutant Y288A shows higher than wild-type uracil uptake activity (Lu et al., 2011). It confers to uracil binding via van der Waals interactions and π-stacking with the pyrimidine ring (Lu et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2017).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.9: Gly289 in UraA.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints: mutant G289A retains high uracil uptake activity with reduced affinity for 5-FU whereas the double mutant F73A/G289A is inefficient in uracil uptake (Botou et al., 2018). Gly289 confers to uracil binding via an H-bond from the backbone amide nitrogen (Lu et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2017). <strong>Gly308 in AcS572: </strong>Replaceable: mutant G308A retains high uracil uptake activity with the same kinetic affinity and capacity as wild type and, in addition, the double mutant F87A/G308A is functionally equivalent in all aspects with F87A (Botou et al., 2018). <strong>Ala308 in RutG: </strong>Replaceable: mutant A308G retains high activity with wild-type kinetic affinity for uracil or thymine and increased binding affinity for 5-FU, thymine, xanthine and oxypurinol and, in addition, the same is true of the double mutant A88F/A308G relative to A88F (Botou et al., 2018). &nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>M10.10: Glu290 in UraA.</strong> Functionally essential: replacement of Glu290 by Ala abrogates uracil uptake and causes loss of uracil binding (Lu et al., 2011).&nbsp; It directly binds uracil with H-bonds from one of the carboxylic oxygen atoms (Lu et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2017).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.11: Asn291 in UraA. </strong>Replaceable: mutant N291A retains the bulk of uracil uptake activity (Lu et al., 2011). Asn291 interacts via an H-bond with His24 at the periphery of the binding site (Lu et al., 2011).</p>

    <p><strong>M12.14: Tyr342 in UraA. </strong>Replaceable: mutant Y342A retains the bulk of uracil uptake activity (Lu et al., 2011). Tyr342 confers to uracil binding by van der Waals interactions in the inward-open conformation of UraA (Lu et al., 2011) but in the occluded conformation it is displaced in the binding site by Ile345 (Yu et al., 2017). &nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>M12.17: Ile345 in UraA. </strong>It confers to uracil binding via van der Waals interactions in the occluded-conformation structure (Yu et al., 2017).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M13</h4>

    <p><strong>M13.1: Arg351 in UraA. </strong>The dimeric interface of UraA at the uracil-bound occluded conformation involves extensive van der Waals contacts between hydrophobic residues on TMs 5/12/13 in each protomer, and H-bonds only between the side chains of Arg351 in one protomer and Asn361 in the other (Yu et al., 2017).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>M13.11: Asn361 in UraA. </strong>The dimeric interface of UraA at the uracil-bound occluded conformation involves extensive van der Waals contacts between hydrophobic residues on TMs 5/12/13 in each protomer, and H-bonds only between the side chains of Arg351 in one protomer and Asn361 in the other (Yu et al., 2017).</p>

    <p><strong>M13.16: Leu366 in UraA.</strong> A double UraA mutant replacing the interface residues Leu366 and Ile374 with Trp yields a constitutive monomer that binds uracil normally but has no transport activity, suggesting that dimer formation is required for transport (Yu et al., 2017).</p>

    <h4>Motif M2</h4>

    <p><strong>M2.9:</strong> Amino acid position corresponding to His24 in UraA (M2.2 of SF1_Cluster C2) and His31 in XanQ (M1.5 of SF1_Cluster C1) based on sequence and predicted structure alignment (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong>Thr38 in AdeP. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by His inactivates the permease; replacement by Ala retains normal activity and kinetics for adenine transport with minor changes in affinity for ligands (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong>Thr35 in GhxP. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by His inactivates the permease; replacement by Ala retains high activity but with reduced affinity for guanine, hypoxanthine and almost all analogs (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong><em>Thr49 in the fungal AzgA</em></strong> is replaceable by Ala or Ser with near-normal growth/activity on hypoxanthine and adenine/guanine (Krypotou et al., 2014)</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M4</h4>

    <p><strong>M4.14: </strong>Amino acid position at the periphery of binding site possibly corresponding to Ser72 in UraA (M3.16 of SF1_Cluster C2) and Asn93 in XanQ or <em>Ser154 in UapA</em> (M3.11 of SF1_Cluster C1) based on sequence and predicted structure alignment (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong>Ala91 in AdeP. </strong>Replaceable: replacement by Gly or Ser leads to highly active permeases and normal kinetics for adenine transport. Mutant A91G is indistinguishable from wild type in specificity profile. Mutant A91S shows decreased affinity for adenine analogs (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong>Ala88 in GhxP. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Gly or Ser leads to highly active permeases but with reduced affinity for guanine and guanine analogs. In addition, mutant A88G displays increased affinity for hypoxanthine and 6-mercaptopurine (Papakostas et al., 2013).</p>

    <p><strong>M4.15: Met92 in AdeP. </strong>At the periphery of the binding site, possibly corresponding to Phe73 in UraA (M3.17 of SF1_Cluster C2) and Phe94 in XanQ or <em>Phe155 in UapA</em> (M3.12 of SF1_Cluster C1) based on sequence and predicted structure alignment (Papakostas et al., 2013). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>M4.16: Gly93 in AdeP. </strong>At the periphery of the binding site, possibly corresponding to Ala74 in UraA (M3.18 of SF1_Cluster C2) and Ser95 in XanQ or <em>Ser156 in UapA</em> (M3.13 of SF1_Cluster C1) based on sequence and predicted structure alignment (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong><em>Gly149 in the fungal AzgA</em></strong> is replaceable with Ala but not with Phe and was considered to be critical for activity (Krypotou et al., 2014)</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M8</h4>

    <p><strong>M8.4: </strong>Amino acid position possibly corresponding to the substrate-binding Glu241 in UraA (M8.9 of SF1_Cluster C2), Glu272 in XanQ or <em>Glu356 in UapA</em> (M8.11 of SF1_Cluster C1), based on sequence and predicted structure alignment (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong>Asp267 in AdeP. </strong>Irreplaceable for function: replacements by Ala, Glu or Asn lead to inactivation or marginally detectable activity and preclude kinetic analysis (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong>Asp271 in GhxP. </strong>Irreplaceable for function: replacement by Glu leads to inactivation, replacements by Ala or Asn result in very low activity that precludes kinetic analysis (Papakostas et al., 2013). <em>Glu342 in the fungal AzgA </em>is critical for activity: functionally irreplaceable with Ala or Asn, but replaceable with Glu albeit with low hypoxanthine transport activity and reduced affinity for adenine and guanine (Krypotou et al., 2014). <em>Glu339 (displaced by one helical turn relative to <strong>Glu342) in AzgA </strong></em>is functionally irreplaceable with Ala, Asn or Glu and may actually be a binding-site residue (Krypotou et al., 2014). &nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>M8.8: </strong>Amino acid position at the binding cavity possibly corresponding to His245 in UraA (M8.13 of SF1_Cluster C2) and Asp276 in XanQ or <em>Asp360 in UapA</em> (M8.15 of SF1_Cluster C1). <strong>Thr271 in AdeP. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacements by Ala or Ser retain high activity but with reduced affinity for substrate or analogs, whereas replacements by Asp or Asn lead to inactivation (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong>Thr275 in GhxP.</strong> Irreplaceable for function: replacements by Ala, Asp, Asn or Ser lead to inactivation (T271A, T271D) or retain marginal (T271N) or very low activity (T271S) that preclude kinetic analysis (Papakostas et al., 2013).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M9</h4>

    <p><strong>M9.13: </strong>Amino acid position corresponding to Asn270 in UraA (M9.17 of SF1_Cluster C2) and Asp304 in XanQ or <em>Asp388 in UapA</em> (M9.10 of SF1_Cluster C1).<strong> Asp298 in AdeP. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Asn inactivates the permease and replacement by Glu retains high activity but with reduced affinity for adenine and adenine analogs (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong>Asp302 in GhxP.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Glu inactivates the permease and replacement by Asn results in a highly active permease with normal hypoxanthine transport properties but deficient in guanine transport (Papakostas et al., 2013).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Motif M10</h4>

    <p><strong>M10.9: </strong>Amino acid position at the binding site possibly corresponding to Gly289 in UraA (M10.9 of SF1_Cluster C2) and Ala323 in XanQ or <em>Ala407 in UapA</em> (M10.6 of SF1_Cluster C1).<strong> Ile317 in AdeP. </strong>Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Glu inactivates the permease and replacement by Ala retains high adenine transport activity and high affinity for adenine and 2,6-diaminopurine but impairs affinity for purine (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong>Ile321 in GhxP.</strong> Replaceable but with constraints: replacement by Ala results in marginal activity. Replacement by Glu results in significant activity for hypoxanthine transport but with reduced affinity for hypoxanthine and hypoxanthine analogs and in negligible guanine transport although guanine and 6-thioguanine appear to bind this mutant with near-wild type affinity (Papakostas et al., 2013).</p>

    <p><strong>M10.10: </strong>Amino acid position at the binding site possibly corresponding to the substrate-binding Glu290 in UraA (M10.10 of SF1_Cluster C2) and Gln324 in XanQ or <em>Glu408 in UapA</em> (M10.7 of SF1_Cluster C1). <strong>Glu318 in AdeP. </strong>Irreplaceable for function: replacement by Asp or Gln leads to inactivation (E318Q) or marginally detected activity (E318D) (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong>Glu322 in GhxP.</strong> Irreplaceable for function: replacement by Asp or Gln leads to marginal (E322Q) or very low activity (E322D) that preclude kinetic analysis (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong><em>Glu394 in the fungal AzgA</em> </strong>is irreplaceable by Ala or Gln but can be replaced by Asp with retention of high activity and normal affinity for hypoxanthine and guanine (Krypotou et al., 2014)</p>

    <p><strong>M10.11: </strong>Amino acid position possibly corresponding to Asn291 in UraA (M10.11 of SF1_Cluster C2) and Asn325 in XanQ or <em>Asn409 in UapA</em> (M10.8 of SF1_Cluster C1). <strong>Ser319 in AdeP. </strong>Replaceable: replacements by Ala or Asn lead to highly active permeases with minor differences in transport properties from the wild-type AdeP (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong>Ser323 in GhxP.</strong> Irreplaceable for function: replacement by Ala or Asn leads to inactivation (Papakostas et al., 2013). <strong><em>Ser395 in the fungal AzgA</em> </strong>is replaceable by Ala or Asn with near-wild type transport properties (Krypotou et al., 2014)</p>
